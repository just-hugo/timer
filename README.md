This is a basic timer, intended to help individuals track their time on projects. This timer has been designed to be embedded in [Notion](https://notion.so/) pages, so that you can start your timer directly from your project's page.

This timer has two modes: interval, and focus.

Interval mode will time you for 15 minutes, and alert you when your time is up. While you are working, it will display a countdown starting from the 15-minute mark. 

Focus mode will track the time you spend on open-ended work. When you start the timer in focus mode, it will begin counting up from 0, and will continue counting time until you stop it.

To use the timer, visit it at https://just-hugo.github.io/timer/ or paste the URL into a Notion page and select the Embed option.
